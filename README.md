# Constellation-Explorer
My website displays a starry sky with animated stars that move and connect to form constellations. When you hover over a star, it reveals a fun constellation fact. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site is interactive, responsive, and immersive for all screen sizes.
